            <P>Java is a <code>high level</code>, <code>robust</code>, <code>secured </code> and <code>object-oriented</code> programming language.</P>
            <P> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is know as a platform.</P>

            <P>Java language is simpe because it is based on C++ and removed many confusing features such as explicit pointers, operator overloading.</P>
            <p class="bg-info"> Obeject-oriented means we oqganize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behaviour.</p>

            <p>Robust simply means strong. <mark>Java uses strong memory management.</mark> There are lack of pointers that avoids security problem. </p>
            <p>There is automatic garbage collection in java. There is exception handling and type checking mechanism in java. All these points makes java robust. </p>

            <p>Java String provides a lot of concepts that can be performed on a string such as compare, concat, equals, split, length, replace, compareTo, intern, substring etc.</p>
            <p>In java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values.</p>

                <p>Generally, string is a sequence of characters. But in java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. String class is used to create string object.</p>
                <p>Each time you create a string literal, the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM </abbr>checks the string constant pool first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned.</p>

                <p>In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.</p>
                <p>Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.</p>
